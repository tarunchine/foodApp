1. I am using 'create-react-app' for initial setup
2. React router is used for routing
3. Redux is used for state management (i am using redux first time)
4. No Css frameworks are used. I could have uses css preprocessor (like scss) to write better css but for such small usecase its not required.
5. To run the project
   npm install
   npm start

6. store
   dataFeched - used to keep track that the data is fetched from server
   isLoading - used to show loader on ui for slow internet
   books - hold the books (each book has a status field to indentify which category it belongs to)

7. Proptype are not used as of now
